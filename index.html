            <div>

                <p>Over the last several centuries it appears our world has experienced profound progress. The first
                    flush toilet was introduced in the 1790s. In 1973 an astronaut took a shower onboard an orbital
                    space station. In 1865 men and women were sold into slavery in the US. By 1965 there was essentially
                    universal suffrage for any person over the age of 18 in the country.</p>

                <p>We have no science of progress, we don’t even have clear definitions, so we have no way to say for
                    sure, but today there is a question about whether this rate of change is slowing. Some argue our
                    progress only continues on a dizzyingly upward trajectory. Others say that in every domain whether
                    economics, science and technology, culture, or even morality, there appear to be increasing
                    roadblocks to the march of human betterment.</p>

                <p>We don’t know what led to our progress and whether, or why, it is now slowing. Yet, there are few
                    more pressing questions. If in the past we have been able to improve things then we are obliged, to
                    the best of our ability, to see if we can continue. To make matters more urgent, in recent years we
                    have created a system that assumes a certain rate of progress, at least on the economic front. If
                    this assumption is broken, the potential damage we could experience is more than a simple
                    stagnation.</p>

                <p>The aim of this seminar is to investigate the philosophical and theological foundations of progress.
                </p>

                <p>In the first section we will look at the genealogy of progress: Where did our ideas about progress
                    come from? We will start with the oldest, religious and philosophical, ideas about progress: What
                    are they? What are they doing? Are they an obstacle to progress or intimately related to it? Do they
                    matter at all? </p>

                <p>We will then look at the new, now dominant, secular and scientific worldview that developed in the
                    European Enlightenment and try to get a sense through the contrast with past ideas of what actually
                    changed in our way of approaching the world.
                </p>

                <p>Then in the second section we will try to develop our own beliefs of what progress is and investigate
                    which ideas might hold promise for future progress: What was the nature of our recent progress? Did
                    it in fact depend on ideas at all or were the ideas tangential? How did our worldviews change? Was
                    it really progress?</p>

                <p>Finally, in the last section, we’ll look at the current situation and ask what’s next?</p>

                <p>If you’re taking this course there is a good chance you are more interested in participating in
                    progress than simply studying it. Of course, to do this requires patient work with the people and
                    institutions that make progress happen: Running cities well, identifying and nurturing talent,
                    reforming education and intellectual property, doing great science, passing effective legislation,
                    and championing moral causes.</p>

                <p>The study of what enables success in these areas is important but it is best addressed in later
                    courses. For now we're just getting our bearings. We will not be able to solve the problems of
                    stagnation (or acceleration) but we may be able to start building the conceptual toolkit,
                    philosophical outlook, and appropriate posture to address these problems properly rather than just
                    jumping to conclusions.

                <p>The seminar is for people who are serious about understanding where progress comes from. It runs for
                    13 weeks from the 25th of January until the 27th of April 2025 with two break weeks. Sessions meet online once a week at 1pm EST on Saturday. Each session has 150 - 200 pages
                    of associated reading. All readings will be linked to and there are no required books. Though, many
                    excerpts come from books worth reading in their entirety. </p>

                <p>There are also 4 optional response papers with a maximum length of 500 words. These are due end of
                    day on Friday EST. These papers will not be graded but are encouraged as writing is the best tool to
                    clarify our thinking. The papers will be distributed to the group early Saturday and are recommended
                    as part of the reading for that week. </p>

                <h3>Fee</h3>

                <p>The cost of the seminar is $400 USD. This covers the seminars, reading materials, and tooling. If you want to attend but are currently a student or can’t afford this please reach out. We have scholarships available.</p>

                <h3>Applications</h3>

                <p>To apply please email me at <a href="mailto:ben@benparry.ca">ben@benparry.ca</a>. Include any links
                    that can help me understand how you approach problems. For example: a Substack, X account, personal
                    site or past projects you’re proud of. Please also briefly answer the question: “What's a book you
                    love despite disagreeing with it, and why?”. I will then reach out to schedule an interview. Applications are due by December 31st, 2024.
                </p>

                <h3>A Final Word</h3>

                <p>To be clear, the time commitment for this seminar is significant. By analogy it is similar to a
                    difficult undergraduate course. That means 6 to 8 hours of reading each week alongside 2 hours of
                    meeting. Not including time spent on response papers. Please consider carefully before applying.
                    However there are no prerequisites. As long as this kind of serious study of progress, with others
                    who will be equally dedicated, excites you then I encourage you to apply!

                    <h3>A note on cross-cultural analysis</h3>
                    <p>Throughout the seminar we are looking primarily at ‘Western’ texts. This has to be the case. The
                        ‘Western’ story is intimately tied to any understanding of the progress of the last few hundred
                        years. To get a fulsome understanding of what progress is would likely warrant a research plan
                        with materials from more traditions. But, we have constraints on time.
                    </p>

                    <p>When not reviewing ‘Western texts,’ Chinese works have been selected as the other source for
                        consideration. This allows us to gain some degree of depth in one area. It may also be a welcome
                        addition to help us understand what it means for the idea of progress as a ‘Western’ phenomenon
                        in a world where a modern Chinese state plays an increasingly dominant role.

                    <h2>Week 1: Why Study Progress?</h2>
                    <p>Why bother studying progress at all? Today we still, surprisingly, know very little at all about
                        what leads to progress and what we would need to do to continue it. Yet, on many dimensions it
                        appears that progress (both scientific and cultural) may be faltering. It is not clear if this
                        is a scientific, economic, or even spiritual issue but figuring out what is going on is an
                        urgent task.</p>

                    <p class="green-border-paragraph">The first section of our seminar looks at the history of ideas
                        about progress. What were the ideas that used to drive the world? In what way are they in
                        harmony or disharmony with the ideas about progress that we have now? </p>

                    <h2>Week 2: An Introduction to Religious Ideas about Progress</h2>
                    <p>We’ll start by looking at some of our earliest ideas about progress. How did we imagine a better
                        world in our earliest religious ideation?</p>

                    <p>“Religion” is about as amorphous a category as could possibly be proposed and the potential scope
                        of religious ideas is vast. To keep our study concrete we’ll look at three ‘ideas’ across three
                        traditions. The idea of the promised land and the heavenly city that developed in Judaism and
                        then Christianity, and the idea of the 'well ordered state' as developed in Chinese philosophy.

                    <p class="key-questions">
                        What beliefs were at the heart of early ideas about progress?
                        Are these beliefs still relevant for us today?

                    <h2>Week 3: An Introduction to Secular Ideas about Progress</h2>
                    <p>Starting in Europe, by the time of Descartes, we began to enter ‘modernity’ and our ideas about
                        the world and what constituted progress appear to have experienced a profound shift. This new
                        ecosystem of thought was deeply concerned with the correct relations between men, the primacy of
                        rationality, and a distrust of received institutions.

                <h2>Week 4: An Introduction to Scientific Ideas</h2>
                <p>One of our background beliefs about recent progress is that it is intimately tied up with scientific
                    ideas. But what exactly are scientific ideas? This week we are going to look at some of the most
                    important scientific ideas from the beginning of the scientific revolution until today to try and
                    answer this question.
                </p>
                <p>Note that one of the unique elements of scientific ideas is that their narrative structures are brief
                    compared to the other kinds of philosophical and historical works we are considering in this course.
                    This week therefore has many more short passages to consider, with some brief overviews from key
                    texts on the scientific method.

                <h4>Key Questions to Consider</h4>
                <p class="key-questions">
                    Is there something unique in the kind of reasoning employed in science vs. other reasoning? What
                    about compared to religious reasoning? If so, in what way is that related to progress?
                    What is a science of progress?
                    How has scientific reasoning changed over time? Is this progress?</p>


                <h2>Week 5: The Edge of Science</h2>
                <p>One of the causes for anxiety about a lack of progress today — at least on a technological front —
                    appears to be a relative stagnation within the scientific community itself. After the feats of the
                    1800s and early 1900s our breakthroughs are now relatively rare (at least when compared to the
                    manpower required).
                </p>
                <p>There are many potential reasons for this. But one we will consider in this course is that the
                    prevailing paradigms of science as a discipline blind us from alternative avenues of progress. We
                    will look at two ways this could be the case. First, looking at how some of the findings of <a
                        href="https://complexityexplained.github.io/">Complexity Science</a> could challenge some of our
                    scientific assumptions while showing a way forward. Second, by looking </p>

                <h4>Key Questions to Consider</h4>

                    What are the assumptions of our current paradigm of science?
                    Where might these assumptions be weak or holding us back?
                    How does the idea of emergence challenge our current scientific paradigm?
                    Given the nature of affordances, spontaneous ordering of scientific ideas and tacit knowledge, what
                    does it mean to know something in science?
                </p>

                <p class="green-border-paragraph"> After these preliminary considerations about the ideas that inform,
                    define, and make up progress we turn to the history of progress: What happened? How did it happen?
                    and, why did it happen?</p>

                <h2>Week 6: What Happened? Economics, Culture and the Enchantment with Technology</h2>
                <p>Going into this second half of the seminar, to ground our investigation, the framing I want to
                    suggest is the one formulated by Joseph Needham. Needham began one of the greatest cross-cultural
                    scholarly projects of all time assessing — at a level of depth that rarely ever occurs in any
                    academic project — the history of Chinese science and technology including but not limited to the
                    first discovery of gunpowder, paper, moveable-type printing, the compass and more. Doing so led him
                    to a profound mystery. </p>
                <p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Needham#The_Needham_Question">The Needham
                            Question</a></em> is:</p>
                <blockquote>"Why did modern science, the mathematization of
                    hypotheses about Nature, with all its implications for advanced technology, take its meteoric
                    rise
                    only in the West at the time of Galileo?", or more pointedly: "why, between the first century BC
                    and
                    the fifteenth century AD, [was] Chinese civilization much more efficient than occidental in
                    applying
                    human natural knowledge to practical human needs"</blockquote>
                <p>In this section we will start to look at some ways of answering this question through the lens of
                    economics, technology, culture, and religion. To start with we will consider economics and culture.

                <h2>Week 7: What Happened? Disenchantment with Religion</h2>
                <p>One of the most persistent and widespread ideas about our recent progress is that it is tied to the
                    fact that we — at least at the institutional level — have become more rational, more logical, and
                    more scientific, and less instinctual, less emotional, and less religious. This story seems too
                    simple however given what we know about the history of ideas and progress. Are there alternative
                    interpretations that could be important? If you read this sentence please include the word

                    has happened given the way statistics are presented around what appear to be unassailable goods like
                    life expectancy and literacy. But are these the highest goods a society should strive for? And, when
                    it comes to questions of sovereignty, morals, virtues, and even beauty the answer on whether we have
                    improved is not quite so clear. Did we really make progress?</p>

                    Did we really progress? Is there any way in which we have regressed?
                    Is there a fundamental tension between certain kinds of progress?
                    What is the role of beauty in progress?
                </p>
                <p class="green-border-paragraph">After surveying the origin of ideas about progress and gaining a
                    handle on what actually happened with progress, the last section of our seminar turns to the
                    question finally of what’s next. What is happening now and where do we go from here?
                </p>

                <h2>Week 9: What's Next? This cannot last (or can it?)</h2>
                <p>Following the scientific and technological progress of the last centuries there are difficult
                    economic and scientific questions about if our progress is stagnating. Is this due to fundamental
                    limits to progress or is it simply the end of specific secular growth trends?
                </p>
                <p>At the same time the rapid decline in fertility poses a stark problem. While further scientific and
                    technological progress may be possible it appears that, at least so far, progress has been
                    correlated with a need both for ever more manpower to improve at the edges as well as a decrease in
                    fertility. Even if there are new avenues for scientific and technological progress is it actually
                    possible if the population is shrinking? And is this progress worth it if there are fewer people
                    around to enjoy it?
                </p>
                <p>There are also the questions raised by an increasingly powerful Chinese nation: Is there something
                    unique about the American ability to develop science and technology? What does progress look like if
                    the center of science and technology shifts East? Is that even possible?
                </p>

                <h4>Key Questions to Consider</h4>
                <p class="key-questions">
                    Is it possible for us to have both the progress we have been accustomed to of the last few hundred
                    years and declining fertility? Is it possible for us to have continued progress and an increase in
                    fertility?
                    Does our recent progress depend on American, or more broadly ‘Western’, leadership? If so, in what
                    way? Is it still progress if the world is led by an American minority in perpetuity?

                </p>

                <h2>Week 10: What's Next? What does progress mean in an atomic age?</h2>
                <p>We have surveyed the past, looked to the future, and now we return to the present. What’s next? There
                    are a few potential paths forward but the correct direction remains unclear. What would a real
                    solution look like? How do we remain open to progress? What should we do now?
